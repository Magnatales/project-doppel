# Art Direction: In Detail

## What is Art Direction?

### Importance of Visuals
Game visuals significantly impact playability, emotional engagement, and aesthetics, making art direction essential to align visual elements with production goals and player experience.

### Beyond Beauty
While beautiful visuals can enhance marketing and appeal (e.g., *Journey* or *Firewatch*), art direction is not solely about creating breathtaking visuals. It is about ensuring that visuals serve the gameplay and narrative.

### Avoiding Bad Design
Poor art direction can make a game unplayable by causing confusion or failing to highlight gameplay-critical elements due to a lack of visual hierarchy.

### Core Goals of Good Art Direction
A well-directed visual design should:
- **Communicate** the message of the scenes.
- **Evokes an emotional charge** that supports the core message.
- **Be visually engaging** and intriguing.

## How to Art Direct Games

### Game Visuals as Moving Images
A game is composed of moving images that players manipulate. Effective art direction ensures these images work individually and cohesively over time.

### Breaking Down the Problem
Designing a single image or snapshot is simpler than tackling an entire game. Focusing on sections or key moments helps identify visual problems and solutions, much like storyboards in film.

### Challenges of Interactivity
- Unlike movies, games involve player interaction, adding complexity to the design problem.
- The more freedom players have (e.g., movement, altering the world), the harder art direction becomes.
- Limiting scope where necessary reduces the complexity of art direction and makes the process more manageable.

### Not All Potential States Are Equal
Players don’t use every possible interaction equally. Observing common player behavior, much like analyzing human movement in architecture, helps designers refine visuals for the most relevant perspectives and interactions.

### Context-Driven Visual Perception
Players interpret game visuals differently based on their gameplay context (e.g., attacker vs. defender). Visual elements gain or lose importance depending on their functional role during play.

### Balancing Visual Design with Gameplay
Adjusting visual elements (e.g., color, lighting, forms) affects gameplay dynamics and player behavior, influencing discoverability and strategic decision-making.

### Science of Visual Understanding
Games rely on images shaped by the science of human perception. Designers can manipulate visual parameters to:
- Communicate messages.
- Evoke emotions.
- Direct attention.

In essence, art direction in games blends visual design with gameplay mechanics, prioritizing both form and function while managing complexity through scope limitation and focused refinement.

## What is Good Art Direction?

### Good Art Direction Defined
Good art direction ensures:
- **Effective communication**: Visuals communicate the game's core messages.
- **Emotional resonance**: Visuals evoke emotions that support the game's narrative or mood.
- **Visual interest**: Engaging aesthetics that captivate the player.

### Core Components
- **Legibility and Readability**: Visual elements must clearly convey their purpose and align with gameplay to avoid confusion.
- **Emotional Resonance**: The visuals should evoke emotions that reinforce the narrative or mood of the game.
- **Visual Interest**: Engaging aesthetics that keep players captivated and enhance the overall experience.

## Legibility, Readability, and Effective Communication

### Legibility and Communication
- **Legibility** refers to the clarity of a game frame—whether players can effectively understand important elements.
- **Techniques for Clarity**: Use contrast to emphasize critical elements and affinity to de-emphasize unimportant ones—"boost the signal, reduce the noise."

### Frame Message Depends on Gameplay
Visual priorities shift depending on the gameplay state within the game loop. Designers must continuously ask, *"What is the main message of this frame?"*

#### Example: *Puzzling Places*
A VR jigsaw puzzle game demonstrates how the player's focus shifts throughout the game loop:
- **Searching for pieces**: Unconnected pieces in the periphery are most important.
- **Connecting pieces**: The connection event takes priority; unconnected pieces become less relevant.

### Importance Hierarchy
Create a visual importance hierarchy for each gameplay state, ranking elements based on what the player needs to see most clearly.

#### Example for a Reward State
- **Connection success** (positive emotional feedback).
- **Progress made**.
- **Context of the connection** (location, piece size, etc.).

Avoid overloading frames with too many focal points; excessive demands indicate a game design flaw as much as an art direction issue.

### Implementing Visual Hierarchy
- Use contrast, size, colors, and other techniques to make top-priority elements stand out.
- De-emphasize or hide unimportant details.

### Less is More
Good art direction is as much about what you **don’t** show as it is about what you do show.

## Real Examples

### Transistor

#### Narrative Exploration:
- **Environment and Storytelling**: In *Transistor*, the environment takes center stage in storytelling. Visual design emphasizes readability, with high contrast ensuring the narrative is communicated effectively.
- **Protagonist Visibility**: The protagonist, Red, is visually prioritized using unique hues (red and green) and value contrast (light and dark), making her stand out against varying backgrounds.

#### Internal Contrast for Consistent Visibility:
- **Bright/Dark Contrast**: Prevents Red from blending into either light or dark areas of the environment.
- **Red/Green Hue Contrast**: Ensures Red’s visibility regardless of surrounding colors.

#### Dynamic Shifts During Movement:
- **Motion and Sparks**: As Red moves, her visibility is enhanced through sparks at her feet, creating additional contrast. These sparks help track her movement by adding visual interest and aiding in navigation.

#### Combat Priority Shift:
- **Visual Focus Shift**: During combat, the environment fades into a more uniform color, reducing distractions. High contrast is then applied to key gameplay elements like enemy markers and battlefield layout.

#### Signal vs. Noise:
- **Exploration**: The environment acts as a signal, conveying narrative and atmosphere.
- **Combat**: The environment becomes noise, blending out to ensure gameplay clarity.

#### Identifying Hierarchy Changes:
- **Exploration vs. Combat**: The importance hierarchy updates based on the situation, focusing on navigation during exploration and prioritizing enemies and tactical options during combat. These changes are driven by gameplay mechanics to maintain visual clarity and support the player’s needs.

**Takeaway**: *Transistor* exemplifies dynamic art direction, adjusting visual priorities to enhance clarity and emotional engagement throughout gameplay.

### Stronghold

#### Difficulty in Detecting Focus Changes:
- Not all gameplay changes are triggered externally; some result from internal shifts in the player’s focus or mental state.

#### Player-Driven Notification:
- Allow the player to signal their shift in focus (e.g., through a button press or mode toggle).

#### Dynamic Visual Adaptation:
- The game updates the importance hierarchy in response to player input, adjusting visuals to prioritize relevant information.

### Hitman

#### Player Modes and Importance Hierarchy:
- *Hitman* and *Assassin’s Creed* adapt their visuals based on the player’s current mode (e.g., exploration, planning, or combat), with each mode emphasizing different priorities in the visual hierarchy.

#### Non-Diegetic and Diegetic Solutions:
- **Non-Diegetic**: External UI elements (e.g., dimming background during weapon selection in *Hitman*).
- **Diegetic**: In-world changes (e.g., camera perspective shifts for aiming in FPS games).

#### Purposeful Separation of Modes:
- Different modes require tailored visual solutions, ensuring clarity without overwhelming the player.

#### The Role of Visual Hierarchy:
- Effective visual hierarchy ensures that players immediately notice important elements without distractions.

#### Common Pitfall:
- A lack of clear visual hierarchy can confuse players, hindering gameplay.

**Baseline for Good Art Direction**: Even if a game isn’t visually stunning, strong art direction ensures that visuals support gameplay by prioritizing clarity and usability.

## Our Visual Mental Model and its Attributes

### Visual Hierarchy and Contrast:
- **Contrast**: The most effective tool for emphasizing an element in the visual hierarchy. Greater differences in value or color make elements stand out.
- **Affinity**: Elements that share similar characteristics blend together, pushing them down the hierarchy.

#### Attributes of the Visual Mental Model:
We decipher images through various attributes, including:
- **Color** (value, hue, saturation)
- **Lines, Shapes, and Orientation**
- **Size, Position, and Rhythm**
- **Light, Texture**
- **Higher-Level Semantics** (e.g., cultural, utility associations)

These attributes shape how we interpret images and determine visual priorities.

#### Art Direction as Problem Solving:
- Art direction solves visual challenges based on gameplay context and production constraints. Focus on manipulating the most important visual attributes for the current gameplay or narrative need.

#### Effective Communication through Visuals:
- The visual hierarchy should reflect the importance hierarchy, ensuring that the player can easily identify what matters most at any given time.
- **Key Goal**: Make elements the player needs to interact with prominent and easy to identify, ensuring smooth gameplay and a coherent experience.

## Emotional Resonance

### Emotions Triggered by Visuals:
- Visuals in games can trigger emotions based on personal experiences and associations. Elements such as colors, shapes, and textures can evoke feelings tied to past encounters, creating emotional responses in the player.

#### Aligning Visuals with Narrative and Gameplay:
- **Hollow Knight**: Visual heaviness reflects the game’s theme of persistence in a dark, challenging world, reinforcing the player’s struggle.
- **Control**: The chaotic visuals reflect the theme of unsettling power and disarray.
- **Transistor**: The Art Deco style conveys the contrast between utopia and failure, symbolizing personal journeys in a decaying city.

#### Emotions through Associations:
- Emotional triggers in games are influenced by associations—visual elements like colors and shapes evoke certain feelings. While these triggers are subjective, some associations (e.g., sunsets or blue skies) tend to evoke similar emotions across cultures.

#### Mood Boards to Shape Emotion:
- Mood boards collect images that evoke the desired emotional tone for the game. Analyzing these visuals can reveal key elements that will help replicate the intended emotional effect in the game.

#### Example of Emotional Design:
- To evoke calmness and focus, designers can use geometric rhythms (e.g., puzzle pieces in structured patterns) and color schemes (e.g., blue and yellow) to promote tranquility, linked to natural associations with calm environments.

### Aligning Visuals, Narrative, and Gameplay:
- The emotional resonance of visuals should align with the narrative, audio, and gameplay to create a coherent emotional experience. Visuals should support the feelings the game aims to evoke and complement the gameplay.

#### In Practice:
- Designers must carefully choose visuals that resonate with the intended emotion, using core attributes (like color or texture) and understanding personal or cultural associations. Thoughtfully applying these elements ensures that the player’s experience matches the emotional response intended by the design.

# Visual Interest

## Keeping the Player Engaged
- **Compelling visuals** are essential for both marketing and gameplay immersion. An engaging image holds the player's attention, but once everything is understood, the interest fades.
- **Variation** is key to maintaining engagement. By adding variation in different visual attributes (such as shape, size, and color), an image remains dynamic and interesting.

## Variation Across Visual Attributes
Variation can be applied to multiple aspects of visuals:
- **Rhythm**: For example, the positioning of lights in *Transistor*.
- **Shape Groups**: Such as triangles, round forms, and squares in *Transistor*, which have narrative significance.
- **Size, Texture, Color, Shape, and Rhythm**: In *Journey*, variation in size, positioning, and orientation keeps the visuals dynamic.

## Importance of Legibility and Hierarchy
- Visually appealing games don't rely solely on variation, but also on **clear legibility** and **visual hierarchy**, ensuring a high signal-to-noise ratio.
- **Clarity** is key, as variations should still allow the player to easily understand what’s important.

## Evoking Emotions with Visuals
- Compelling visuals need to **evoke the right emotions**. They should align with the game's narrative and atmosphere to create a cohesive experience.
- In summary: Compelling visuals rely on variation across visual attributes to keep attention, balanced with legibility and hierarchy to ensure clarity. Additionally, visuals should align with the game's emotional tone and narrative.

# Harmony and Chaos

## Chaos in Visuals
- **Chaos** occurs when elements in an image lack a clear relationship, making it hard for the brain to understand the scene. This can lead to confusion and discomfort for the viewer.
- Physical discomfort can arise from chaotic visuals, as the brain struggles to make sense of disorganized elements.

## Creating Harmony
- **Harmony** is achieved when variations are related in a simple and understandable way, helping the brain quickly process and interpret the scene.
- For example, consistent ratios like **1:2:4** for object sizes create order and make the scene visually pleasing without overwhelming the viewer.
- Visual harmony results from thoughtful relationships between visual elements like color, shape, and size, which complement rather than compete with each other.

## Balance Between Interest and Clarity
- To avoid chaos, **variations should be simple and organized**. They should enhance visual interest without overwhelming the player.
- Excessive unrelated variations or complex relationships can lead to chaotic visuals, reducing both **interest** and **clarity**, and negatively affecting emotional tone.

## In Summary
- Variations should be **harmoniously related**, ensuring clarity while enhancing visual interest. Simple, cohesive changes in visuals keep the player engaged without overwhelming their ability to process the scene. Harmony supports both clarity and emotional tone.
